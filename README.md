This project is the brainchild of my brother James, who has tasked me with creating something that would allow the user to upload a .csv, that returns a filtered version only containing what is useful to them. _What is useful to the user_ is something that hasn't yet been passed onto me, along with the specifics of the project, but this is probably a good place to start.
